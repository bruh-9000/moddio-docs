# How to contribute

First, we strongly recommend you to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/XRe8T7K) server. This is where you can best communicate with other community members.
We are always looking for more help from the community. PRs are always welcome.


# Documentation Contribution

The best way to contribute in documentation is by loading the documentation on your local machine as instructed [here](https://github.com/moddio/moddio-docs/edit/main/README.md).
With this approach, you can preview your changes locally. 

Once your changes are ready to be submitted, create a Pull Request in the [Moddio Docs Github Repo](https://github.com/moddio/moddio-docs/pulls), and someone from our core team will review.


# Game Engine Contribution

[Moddio Engine](https://github.com/moddio/moddio2) is completely free and open source under the MIT license.
Try running the game engine locally and make changes as you deem necessary.

We strongly recommend you to familarize yourself with [Moddio Game Editor](https://www.modd.io/create). To learn how to use the editor, visit [https://learn.modd.io](https://learn.modd.io).

Once your changes are ready to be submitted, create a PR in [Moddio Game Engine Github Repo](https://github.com/moddio/moddio2), and someone from our core team will review.
