# Overview

Returns a simplified time string. Does not display empty values for hours or minutes if applicable.

## Examples

- Instead of showing something like `00:00:50` for 50 seconds, it will just show `50`
- Instead of showing something like `00:12:50` for 12 minutes and 50 seconds, it will just show `12:50`
- Times with hours, minutes, *and* seconds, it will not affect the time string
