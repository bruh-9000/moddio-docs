Triggers the script when the game has already sent out too many Modd Coins that day.

## How it works

Game owners who are sending out coins can set a maximum limit to how many coins can be transferred every real-life day. All Modd Coins sent out by the game will contribute to this limit, and when it is reached this script will trigger when the game attempts to give coins to a player.
