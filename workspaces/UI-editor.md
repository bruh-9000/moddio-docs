# UI Editor

The UI Editor is where you can customize and create the UI for your game.
We use HTML, CSS and Handlebars to create the UI.

## Accessing the UI Editor

To access the UI Editor, click on the `UI` tab in the top menu.

## UI Editor Interface

The UI Editor interface is divided into 3 main sections:

1. **Left Panel**: This is where you can see all the created UI elements for your game.
2. **Middle Panel**: This is where you can edit the properties of the UI element that you have selected.
3. **Top Right Panel**: This is where you can save, preview or reset all changes made to the UI template.
