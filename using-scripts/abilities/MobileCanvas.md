# Overview

The mobile canvas is the UI players on mobile view.

## What is the Mobile Canvas?

The Mobile Canvas allows mobile players to play your game, through movement, keybinds, using items, and more.

## Usage

In the in-game editor, this is what the Mobile Canvas looks like.

Click on a keybind, and then drag it around to where you want it to appear on the mobile view. If the keybind starts an ability, the icon of that ability will be displayed instead of the keybind.

Players can click on this to use whatever it is attached to. Only mobile players can see this.
