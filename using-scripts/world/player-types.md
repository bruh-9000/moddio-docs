# Player Types (Factions)

## Creating a New Player Type

In the Entities tab in the in-game editor, you can click on the Player Types button, then on the Add New button to create a new player type.

### Name

You can set the player type's name, but no player will be able to see this name.

### Color

You can assign player types colors. This will display their name in chat to be that color along with their player name in-game.

### Attributes

Every player type can have attributes in it. Attributes can only be integers.

### Variables

Every player type can have variables in it. These variables can be of any variable type, including numbers, strings, booleans, and more.

### Diplomacy

You can set the relationship between player types towards other player types. There are three options of diplomacy, hostile, neutral and peaceful. This will affect different things, like if an AI will attack another unit, if a weapon can damage a unit, and more.
