# Dialogues

Dialogues are pop-ups that can be interactive, or not.

## Creating a New Dialogue

To create a new dialogue, go to the Entities tab in the in-game editor, then select Dialogues. Finally, click the Add New button to start creating a new dialogue.

### Name

You can set the name of the dialogue. Only developers will be able to view this.

### Title

You can set the title of the dialogue. This is what players will see.

### HTML Message

You can put HTML in the message body, and it will function as normal (for most HTML things, but some are banned)

### Image

You can attach up to one image per dialogue which will be displayed to the left of the dialogue text.

### Letter Print Speed

With a default of 20, print speed is how fast letters pop up on dialogues. Dialogues by default display letters one by one until the message is complete. After it is complete, the dialogue options will pop up.

## Options

Options in dialogues can do nothing, run scripts, or trigger a follow-up dialogue.
