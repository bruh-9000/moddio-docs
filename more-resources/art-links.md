### Pixel Art

Some amazing websites for creating your own pixel art are <a href="https://www.pixilart.com/">Pixilart</a> and <a href="https://piskelapp.com">Piskel</a>. You can find many tutorials for them on YouTube.

### Vector Art

Vector is a type of images where the image is not stored in pixels, but in points. This art can be zoomed into infinitely and will not start to become pixilated. One awesome website for making art with this style is <a href="https://cloud.gravit.io/">Gravit</a>. You can find many tutorials for it on YouTube. Keep in mind that making vector art is slightly harder than pixel art.
